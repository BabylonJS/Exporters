# ⚠️
The Babylon.js Exporters are no longer in active development. While the tools will continue to work for existing versions of Maya & Max (2022), we cannot guarantee that they will continue to work for future versions. If you are interested in helping us maintain these tools for future versions of Maya & Max, we'd GLADLY welcome the help, please contact us on the [Babylon.js Forum](https://forum.babylonjs.com/)

For alternative export options, please see this doc: https://doc.babylonjs.com/preparingArtForBabylon/dccToGltf
